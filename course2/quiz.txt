Question 1
Which factors substantially complicate production machine learning? (Check all that apply)

0.5 / 1 point

Model Retraining driven by model improvements


Ground truth that changes slowly

This should not be selected
It’s the other way around actually. This situation would not be particularly difficult to handle in production.


Labeling through Weak Supervision


Model Retraining driven by declining model performance.

Correct
Right choice!

Question 2
Direct Labeling is one of the methods used in production ML to label data. About it we can say that:

0.5 / 1 point

It needs to match prediction results with their corresponding original inference request.


With it, obtained labels don’t adapt quickly to world changes


It captures strong label signals

Correct
That’s correct!


It can be applied very often in many scenarios

This should not be selected
On the contrary, it’s often not possible because of the inherent nature of the problems or systems
